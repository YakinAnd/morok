# Changelog

## [1.1.1] — 2026-05-19

### Bug fixes

- **kerb-enum `--proxy` silently ignored** — the `--proxy socks5://...` flag was registered on the `kerb-enum` command but the value was never passed into the dialer; all AS-REQ connections were made directly regardless of the flag. Fixed: `proxyURL` is now forwarded to the SOCKS5 dialer.
- **`smb` command has no proxy support** — `CheckSMBSigning` connected to port 445 via `net.DialTimeout` with no proxy path. Fixed: `--proxy` now routes SMB2 Negotiate traffic through the SOCKS5 proxy, consistent with all other commands.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-15

### New: History tab — remediation tracking across reports

The HTML report now includes a **History** tab that turns individual point-in-time reports into a remediation timeline. Load one or more older morok reports as baselines and compare them against the current report — entirely in the browser, no data sent anywhere.

- **Executive Verdict** — auto-generated one-sentence narrative with grade, score, and delta (suitable for slide decks)
- **Summary metric cards** — Risk Score, Attack Surface, Attack Paths, Critical Findings; each shows current value, % delta, and "was N"
- **Risk score trend chart** — inline SVG line chart across all loaded snapshots; color encodes direction (green = improved, red = regressed)
- **Timeline table** — one row per report, sorted oldest → newest; grade, score, critical/high/medium counts
- **Findings Before → After** — categories split into three groups:
  - **Regressions** — new or worsened findings (shown first)
  - **Resolved & Improved** — findings eliminated or reduced since baseline
  - **Outstanding** — unchanged since baseline
  - Dual date-labeled bars, ✓ Fixed badge for zero-count categories, NEW badge for categories absent in baseline
- Works fully offline — no server, no uploads
- Requires morok v1.1.0+ for both the current report and any baseline (older reports are rejected with a clear error)

### Other changes

- Version string updated to `v1.1.0` in CLI and HTML report
- HTML report embeds a compact JSON snapshot (`<script id="morok-data">`) used by the History tab

- **`--verbose`** — show all findings without per-section truncation
- **`--stealth`** — minimal LDAP footprint, skips ACL/GPO/ADCS/delegation
- **`--report`** — generate self-contained HTML report
- **`--json`** — export AD objects as JSON (BloodHound CE v5 compatible)
- **`--proxy`** — SOCKS5 proxy support for pivoting
- **`--scope`** — restrict enumeration to specific OU/DN
- **Risk score footer** — `RISK CRITICAL (F · 83/100)` + timing after every run
- **Severity prefixes** — `[+++]` critical · `[++]` high · `[+]` medium with color coding
